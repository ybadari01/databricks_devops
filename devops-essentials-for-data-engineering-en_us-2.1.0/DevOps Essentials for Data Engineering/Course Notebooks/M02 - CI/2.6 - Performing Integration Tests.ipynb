    "# 2.6 - Performing Integration Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "Integration tests for data engineering ensures that different components of the data pipeline, such as data ingestion, transformation, storage, and retrieval, work together seamlessly in a real-world environment. These tests validate the flow of data across systems, checking for issues like data consistency, format mismatches, and processing errors when components interact as expected.\n",

    "There are multiple ways to implement integration tests within Databricks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Lakeflow Spark Declarative Pipeline (Formerly DLT)**: With Lakeflow Spark Declarative Pipelines, you can use expectations to check pipeline’s results.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Jobs**: You can also perform integration tests as a Databricks Jobs with tasks - similarly what is typically done for Non-Spark Declarative Pipeline code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demonstration, we will quickly introduce to you how to perform simple integration tests with Delta Live Tables and discuss how to implement them with Jobs. Prior knowledge of Lakeflow Spark Declarative Pipeline and Lakeflow Jobs is assumed.\n",
