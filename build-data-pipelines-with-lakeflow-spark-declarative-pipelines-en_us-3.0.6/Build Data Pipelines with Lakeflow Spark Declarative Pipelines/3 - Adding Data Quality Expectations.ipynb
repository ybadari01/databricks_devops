    "\n",
    "In this demonstration we will add data quality expectations to apply quality constraints that validates data as it flows through Lakeflow Spark Declarative Pipelines. Expectations provide greater insight into data quality metrics and allow you to fail updates or drop records when detecting invalid records.\n",

    "### Learning Objectives\n",

    "By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:\n",
    "- Add quality constraints within a Lakeflow Spark Declarative Pipeline to trigger appropriate actions (warn, drop, or fail) based on data expectations.\n",
    "- Analyze pipeline metrics to identify and interpret data quality issues across different data flows."
