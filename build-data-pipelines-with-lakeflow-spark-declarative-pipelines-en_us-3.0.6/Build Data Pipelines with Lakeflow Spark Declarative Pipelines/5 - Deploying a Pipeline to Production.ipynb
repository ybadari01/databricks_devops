    "- **HIDDEN EVENT LOG:** By default, Spark Declarative Pipelines writes the event log to a hidden Delta table in the default catalog and schema configured for the pipeline. While hidden, the table can still be queried by all sufficiently privileged users. By default, only the owner of the pipeline can query the event log table. By default, the name for the hidden event log is formatted as:  \n",
